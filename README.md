----

Hieracles is a command-line tool for analysis and deep examination of [Hiera][hiera] paramaters in a [Puppet][puppet] setup. It's used internally at [Gandi][gandi] and its first incarnation is strongly tied to Gandi puppet architecture. But Hieracles tends to become, in time, a generic Hiera overlay visualisation tool.

Install
-----------
At this stage, it's to early to even think about installing anything. The internal code from Gandi is still in progress of transition towards total freedom.
